The image processing rely on a few public-free available softwares. You can download, install and acquire the manuals of these softwares using the following links:

Lesion Segmentation Tool (version 3.0.0,  based on Matlab 2019a [9.6.0.1072779]; 64-bit [win64]; License Number: 968398): https://www.applied-statistics.de/lst.html. 

Computational Anatomy Toolbox (CAT) in Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM12) based on Matlab 2019a :
https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/. 

FMRIB Software Library (version 6.0 based on Linux Ubuntu 18.04.2): https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FSL.  

Accelerated Microstructure Imaging via Convex Optimization (AMICO, python 3.7, based on Linux Ubuntu 18.04.2): https://github.com/daducci/AMICO.

Home-developed scripts and example data: 
Home-developed scripts: https://github.com/zhuozhizheng/Periventricular-gradient-of-NAWM. 

Example data including image, gene and clinical information were also upload onto GitHub: https://github.com/zhuozhizheng/Periventricular-gradient-of-NAWM.

The lesion segmentation and lesion filling for T1w images could be found in LST manual. 

The image brain tissue segmentation of T1 images could be found in the Cat12 manual. 

The diffusion data processing, NODDI parameter fitting and normalization into MNI space could be found in file “Diffusion_image_processing_and_NODDI_metric_calculation”

The ventricular mask for population and individuals could be found in file “Ventricular_mask_creation”.

The definition of periventricular map and ring, the NDI and ODI extraction of NAWM rings could be found in file “Periventricular_ ring_map_and_value_extraction”. 

Main statistical analysis using linear mixed model and linear regression to explore the clinical associations of the gradient could be found in file ‘Statistical_analysis’.

The Partial Least Squares and CNS celltype enrichment analysis as well as disease_GWAS_gene overlaps could be found in file “Statistical_analysis” 

Additional important figure plot scripts could be found in file “figure_plot”. 

Example data including image, gene and clinical information could be found in file “data”.

All the shell scripts were tested on Linux Ubuntu 18.04.2. Matlab scripts were tested on Matlab 2019a on windows 10 system. R scripts were tested on RStudio 2022.02.2 on windows 10 system.
